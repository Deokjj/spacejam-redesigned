        <b>Bugs Rabbit</b>
        <p>Bugs Bunny, the linchpin of the Looney Tunes, has been called everything from
        "classic" to "perennial" to "an American institution" to "one of our national
        heroes"--and "wascally wabbit," "long-eared galoot," and a lot of other things
        besides!  But most of us just like to call him Bugs.</p>
        <p>Now he's starring in <b><i>Space Jam</i></b>, Warner Bros.' first original
        feature film graced by Bugs in a leading role--opposite Michael Jordan, no less!
        Producer Ivan Reitman and director Joe Pytka head a team of filmmakers
        including producers Joe Medjuck and Daniel Goldberg, executive producers Ken
        Ross and David Falk, and screenwriters Leo Benvenuti &amp; Steve Rudnick and
        Timothy Harris &amp; Herschel Weingrod to bring this ambitious and
        precedent-setting project to life.  Starring with Bugs and Michael Jordan are
        Wayne Knight, Theresa Randle and the voice of Danny DeVito.</p>
        <p>Heading the bill in <b><i>Space Jam</i></b> with one of the sports world's most
        entertaining players is a natural opportunity for the venerable Warner Bros.
        character.  After all, Bugs was voted the most popular in the entire
        short-subject field in the United States and Canada for the year 1945, and then
        stayed in the Number One spot for the next 16 years straight.  Today, in 1996,
        Bugs continues to draw a crowd--in fact, a recent survey showed him to be the
        most popular animated character in the world!</p>

      <b>Daffy Duck</b><p>

      <b></b>The only major Warner Bros. cartoon stars to be established
      <b>before</b> Bugs, rather than in the wake of his success were Daffy Duck and
      Porky Pig.  Daffy started life as the target of a hunter's rifle, just as Bugs
      did, and became a comedian through a totally unexpected reaction to that
      fact.</p><p>

      The film was <i>Porky's Duck Hunt</i>.  A hunter himself, Avery thought it
      would be funny if one of Nature's Own turned the tables on his oppressor, and
      he created a screwball duck who <b>didn't</b> get scared and run away when
      somebody pointed a gun at him, but leapt and hopped all over the place like a
      maniac.  In his best scene, the screwball duck does nothing more than dance
      away over a lake, in one long, mad shot--no camera movement, no great dialogue,
      just "Hoo-Hoo, Hoo-Hoo, Hoo-Hoo!," hopping on the water, turning handsprings,
      bouncing on his head, tumbling in the air, sidling on his heel, splashing on
      the surface, skidding far out of sight, and then swooping back again for
      another round.</p>

        <b>Porky Pig</b><p>
        The first of the familiar Warners Cartoon stars was Mr. Porcine "Porky"
        Pig.  Porky emerged a star from Friz Freleng's<b><i> I Haven't Got a
        Hat</i></b> as early as 1935.  According to Director Freleng, "When I was a
        kid, I had two playmates--a little fat kid called Piggy and his younger brother,
        who was called Porky.  I always wanted to do a comic strip with two kids with
        those names.  But in animation, everything is animals, so when I had this
        classroom cartoon, I thought of Porky."</p><p>

        Friz Freleng saud,  "We were searching for a new character,and the audience
        told us Porky was the guy."</p>

      <b>Taz</b><p>

      <b></b>The <b>youngest</b> and, according to some, the most exciting of the
      Warner Bros. classic cartoon characters is Bugs' most mindless, most ferocious
      antagonist, The Tasmanian Devil.  Baroque enough that there should <b>be</b>
      such a cartoon character as a Tasmanian Devil;  a name would just be excess
      baggage.</p><p>

      Taz has now become one of the most popular in the entire Looney Tunes gallery.
      He was literally thrown away when Warner supervisor Ed Selzer forbade his
      director, Bob McKimson, to bring him back for any more encores after his
      premiere appearance in <i>Devil May Hare</i> in 1954.  But when Jack Warner
      started to miss the little Devil, and ask when he was going to show up again,
      Selzer had to rescind that order.</p><p>

      When Mel Blanc began to develop a voice for this new character, he asked, all
      innocence, "What does he sound like?" and was told, "Nobody has ever heard
      one."  So he was compelled to ad-lib some kind of glottal-guttural gravelly
      gargle,  now lovingly described as "Taz-speak."</p>

      <b>Tweety &amp; Sylvester</b><p>

      It was in a Merrie Melodie called <i>Tweetie Pie</i>, directed by Friz Freleng
      and released in 1947, that this endearing and enduring pair was first teamed,
      demonstrating that their cat-and-bird game was irresistible to audiences,
      bringing home the first of the Warner cartoonists' Academy Awards, and kicking
      off a series that would run until the studio closed, and then beyond.  In 42
      animated adventures (all but one directed by Freleng) this baby-talking bird
      who just bordered on the precious proved that he was not above using pins,
      needles, tacks, darts, saws, shovels, mallets, anvils, anchors, barbed wire,
      chemicals, roller skates, bowling balls, baseball bats, seltzer bottles, boxing
      gloves, vicious dogs, lions, Bengal tigers, sharks, firearms, blowtorches,
      dynamite, skyrockets, or cannons, if the need arose, to ward off the
      threatening "puddy tat."</p>

      <b>Elmer</b><p>

      <b></b>Basking in residual glamor from The Rabbit's stunning success was the
      hunter who first pointed that infamous rifle in his face.  Elmer Fudd, Bugs'
      foil in <i>A Wild Hare</i>,<b> </b>became part of the Bugs Bunny mystique right
      from the beginning, and began a long cartoon career as journeyman stooge, dupe,
      and second banana at the instant he was chosen to have the words, "What's up,
      Doc?" directed at <b>him--</b>a classic case of being in the right place at the
      right time</p><p>

      Elmer Fudd, like Bugs Bunny, seemed to crystallize in <i>A Wild Hare</i>, going
      through various permutations later, only to settle back into a form remarkably
      like the one he'd had his first success in.</p>

      <b>Road Runner &amp; Coyote</b><p>

      In the late '40s, storyman Michael Maltese and director Chuck Jones were
      searching for the right combination of far-out animals to populate the cartoon
      they envisioned as a parody of the constant chases that had come to dominate
      animation.  They finally settled on an emaciated Coyote chasing a supersonic
      Road Runner and got it on the screen in <i>Fast and Furry-ous</i> in 1949.
      Audiences laughed, but no one saw it as a parody of anything.  So for 15 years,
      Maltese and Jones had to content themselves with turning out one of the most
      popular series of cartoons ever made.</p><p>

      Most of us, having attempted to capture a roadrunner two or three times and
      failed, would give up and go chase a rabbit.  But Wile E. Coyote is earnestly
      trying to prove to himself that such a thing is possible for him.  And he has
      somehow gotten the idea that since simple schemes don't work, complicated ones
      must be the answer.  </p>
